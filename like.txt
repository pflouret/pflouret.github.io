random stuff i enjoy

the scalding feeling of frozen feet and a hot shower, the
sound snow makes when you step on it and the smell of it
when you first go out of the house, clapping randomly out of
time when people sing happy birthday, any sort of
extraordinary meteorological phenomenon, black clouds and
the sense of impending doom, run-down museums, standing on
pine needles, fog, that time of the afternoon the city has a
purplish tint, getting lost in menial thoughts in long
showers, witbier, the wikipedia spiral of death, swimming
pools in the rain, hedgehogs, looking at old pictures,
stealing office supplies, threshold consciousness
hallucinations, very loud concerts, peering into people's
lives in opposite buildings, architecture, the tetris
effect, geology, abstract paintings, brunch, deep-ocean
creatures, comma splices, a well placed snort, air drumming,
headbanging, the word 'indeed', seasons, rocking chairs,
eggs florentine, chocolate milk, memorizing lyrics, swearing
loudly, whistling in the halls, roadtrips across desolate
places, thinly-sliced radish, brownies, modular origami,
islamic art, polygons, non sequiturs, etc.
